# DIO | Bootcamp Bradesco - Java Cloud Native
This repository serves as both a **portfolio** and **backup** for the skills and projects I am learning during my
[BootCamp](https://web.dio.me/track/bradesco-java-cloud-native?tab=path) focused on mastering Java, Spring Boot, and cloud technologies, including Azure.

## About

---
This repository is structured to showcase the progression of my learning journey in building cloud-native applications
using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **other cloud-related technologies**. As I progress, I will include various
resources, projects, and examples that demonstrate my growth and expertise in creating scalable, resilient, and
cloud-optimized applications.

In total, there should be 17 projects applying the core principles and techniques learned in the program,
increasing in complexity, at the end. These projects might be implemented in their own repositories.
